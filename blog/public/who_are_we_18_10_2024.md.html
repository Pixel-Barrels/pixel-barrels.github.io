        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
<p>Hello! we're Pixel Barrels, a project made to create new experiences that players can enjoy and remember. We're the developers behind the ShapeWorld series and we're currently developing the last game of the ShapeWorld series, ShapeWorld: FightLand.</p>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<h1>Our projects</h1>
<p>As we said before, we're developers of the ShapeWorld series, the ShapeWorld series consists in five games:</p>

<br>
<ul>
<li>The Duck Bomb</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ShapeWorld: Origins</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ShapeWorld: After Origins</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fall To Hell</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ShapeWorld: FightLand</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>(You can find those games <a href="../../games.html">here</a>)</p>

<br>
<p>Those games are connected and take place in the same universe but the main games of the ShapeWorld series are ShapeWorld: Origins, ShapeWorld: After Origins and ShapeWorld: FightLand.</p>

<br>
<p>The ShapeWorld series is close to it's end but all our past and future games will be connected.</p>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<h1>Future</h1>
<p>Currently, we're developing ShapeWorld: FightLand, the development started in December 2023 and is our biggest game at this moment, <a href="https://youtu.be/vyIgHrNujlE?si=XNxa2ue3Gkag1Y0H">a trailer was released months ago</a> but the game has changed a lot since the release of that trailer so you will have to wait until the next announcement.</p>

<br>
<p>ShapeWorld: FightLand will be released as an Early Access, featuring the first two zones with an open-world gameplay. We hope our players will enjoy this game.</p>
