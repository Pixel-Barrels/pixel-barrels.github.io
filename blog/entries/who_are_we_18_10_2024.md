# Our projects
As we said before, we're developers of the ShapeWorld series, the ShapeWorld series consists in five games:

* The Duck Bomb
* ShapeWorld: Origins
* ShapeWorld: After Origins
* Fall To Hell
* ShapeWorld: FightLand

(You can find those games [here](../../games.html))

Those games are connected and take place in the same universe but the main games of the ShapeWorld series are ShapeWorld: Origins, ShapeWorld: After Origins and ShapeWorld: FightLand.

The ShapeWorld series is close to it's end but all our past and future games will be connected.

# Future
Currently, we're developing ShapeWorld: FightLand, the development started in December 2023 and is our biggest game at this moment, [a trailer was released months ago](https://youtu.be/vyIgHrNujlE?si=XNxa2ue3Gkag1Y0H) but the game has changed a lot since the release of that trailer so you will have to wait until the next announcement.

ShapeWorld: FightLand will be released as an Early Access, featuring the first two zones with an open-world gameplay. We hope our players will enjoy this game.
